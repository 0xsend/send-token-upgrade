To change this, you should override\n this function so it returns a different value.\n We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert\n instead returning `false` on failure.

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve]. NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance is the maximum `uint256`. Requirements: - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address. - `from` must have a balance of at least `value`. - the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least `value`.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":\"ERC20\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/draft-IERC6093.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x880da465c203cec76b10d72dbd87c80f387df4102274f23eea1f9c9b0918792b\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://399594cd8bb0143bc9e55e0f1d071d0d8c850a394fb7a319d50edd55d9ed822b\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbPZzgtT6LEm9CMqWfagQFwETbV1ztpECBB1DtQHrKiRz\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbf61ab2ae1d575a17ea58fbb99ca232baddcc4e0eeea180e84cbc74b0c348b31\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://4e0968705bad99747a8e5288aa008678c2be2f471f919dce3925a3cc4f1dee09\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmbAFnCQfo4tw6ssfQSjhA5LzwHWNNryXN8bX7ty8jiqqn\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xe06a3f08a987af6ad2e1c1e774405d4fe08f1694b67517438b467cecf0da0ef7\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://df6f0c459663c9858b6cba2cda1d14a7d05a985bed6d2de72bd8e78c25ee79db\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeTTxZ7qVk9rjEv2R4CpCwdf8UMCcRqDNMvzNxHc3Fnn9\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Metadata.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x70f2f713b13b7ce4610bcd0ac9fec0f3cc43693b043abcb8dc40a42a726eb330\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://c13d13304ac79a83ab1c30168967d19e2203342ebbd6a9bbce4db7550522dcbf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmeN5jKMN2vw5bhacr6tkg78afbTTZUeaacNHqjWt4Ew1r\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]}},\"version\":1}"
